# BookSave

BookSave is a web app that help users find inspiration for reading books.

* A Place where you can search and save different books in a **"To-read" list**.
* After you have finished reading a book, it can be saved in a so called **"Finished" list**.
* You can grade the book based on how much you liked it.

BookSave uses [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books).

This project was made with [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

## React VS Angular / Vue.js

Why we chose React over Angular or Vue:

* React is scalable and flexible.
* React is popular and used by many today. This means greater opportunity for solution proposals for any code-related problems.
* It is modular, which means that it is made up of a collection of "building blocks" that can be configured in different ways, based on need.
* React has an easier learning curve (in our opinion) compared to the other two.
* Having knowledge about React is highly sought after among employers. 

#### Angular
* Due to its complexity, we considered it unsuitable for this particular short-term project.
* Compared to React, the learning curve is steep which makes it more difficult to learn as a beginner.
* It uses TypeScrift which we are not used to, therefore we felt that we did not learn for this project


## Install

First, make sure you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Create a new file called `keys.json` with structure identical to `keys.json.ex`
Ask the developers of this project for the API-key to be put inside **keys.json**. 

Afterwards open a terminal and type:
```
$ cd booksave
$ npm install
```

## How to Run

In that same project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
